# Bike Sharing
## Overview

Des Moines is an ambitious target for our company. Bike sharing has always been a targeted idea for populous areas, however we have found through analysis of certain areas that we do see these bike be used for more than just tourism. We will go into more depth with those answers below.

## Results

Using [this Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/5ZY74BKWR?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) we can take a much more detailed look at the August 2018 ride data.

- *Centers vs Suburbs:* Realistically city centers draw more people than areas such as suburbs. Using our starting location information, the center of New York had more activity than the surrounding areas.
- *Trips by Day of Week:* Bikes are more commonly used during the 8AM and 5PM commutes in New York. We can draw the same conclusion for the Des Moines branch of this company.
- *Trips by Time of Day:* The workweek does really make the data look convincing as we have almost 50,000 more rentals per day at the end of work commutes than morning commutes.
- *Trip Duration:* To even further hammer in the idea that these bikes are used by commuters, we see that most usage of these bikes last 30 minutes or less.
- *Trip Duration by Gender:* While we have the trips broken down by gender, we find that 3 times more males use these bikes than females.
- *Trip by time of day by Gender:* We've broken down the time of day to better represent females and male utilization and again find males using more than females.
- *Type of Customer by Day of the Week:* Most customers that we get are subscribers during the workweek, but as we get into the weekends, single use customers take more of the utliization than they do on weekdays.

## Analysis
Ultimately, bike sharing is successful in high density areas due to how easily accessible any given destination is for a person. Des Moines is going to be less successful due to the nature of how the city is laidout and that there are less people in the area resulting in less density. While I am not saying the proposal will end up being not profitable, do not expect the same level of profits that we would see from New York. I would recommend we do an analysis of a city that better matches Des Moines to get a better idea of comparison.

Additionally, I would recommend we look at visualizing where bikes start and end to see if we need to better manage return stations or move bikes back to the city center. We also should look at showcasing a year long prospect as loking at one month's worth of data may give a good idea for one season, it may not give information on usage and maintainenance for other seasons.
